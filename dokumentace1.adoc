=== Workflow
==== Step 1) Cropping source files

Starting with the scissors tool, a rough outline was selected on both the mask, figure and legs.
Furthermore the created selection was used to add a layer mask. Using a paintbrush tool of *size 4-18* with brush type: *2. Hardness 075*, by painting into the layer mask, selection was adjusted to finely crop the objects.

==== Step 2) Composition of elements

Mask and body of the figure were moved to fitted into the enviroment using the *move tool*.   Furthermore, leg was cropped and fitted on the body of the figure. The second leg was made by coppying the first one, then using the *shear and scale tools* it was transformed to fit the enviroment.

A copy of the background layer was made.
Using the same workflow as with previous croppings. The fence was isolated from this copy and its layer moved infront of the figure.

==== Step 3) Shadow and reflection

The mask and the figure layers were coppied. Using the *brush tool* with brush type *2. Hardness 100*, the mask and figure were painted black, merged into a single layer which opacity has been changed to 62. And then transformed using the *shear and scale tools*. Adjustments were made with brush type *2. Hardness 075* to highlight certain parts, for example the shadow on the column. Other parts were extentuated using the eraser tool, mostly around the dim orange light placed in the shadow.

Light reflection effect was increased on the reflecting part of the mask, using a brush tool of size: 5, type: 2. Hardness 075 and color white.

==== Step 4) Filter

A filter was created using a large *airbrush tool of type 2. Hardness 075*. Selectively darkening certain areas while keeping others fully untouched. The canvas of the image was then resized, cutting of the top part in the process.

=== Workflow

==== Step 1) Cropping source files

Starting with the scissors tool, a rough outline was selected on both the figure.
Furthermore the created selection was used to add a layer mask. Using a paintbrush tool of *size 4-18* with brush type: *2. Hardness 075*, by painting into the layer mask, selection was adjusted to finely crop the objects. The cropped mask was reused from bitmap 1.

==== Step 2) Composition of elements

Mask and body of the figure were moved to fitted into the enviroment using the *move tool*. Furthermore a copy of the mask layer was made, its *opacity changed to 60%* and moved right to mirror the movement seen in the figure's original head. A *brush tool* was used to add the missing left leg, picking out colours from the present one.

==== Step 3) Filter

The mask and body layers were merged into one and then copied. The copy was colorized, using the *colorize tool* into a teal color picked out from the enviroment. Its opacity then changed to 11.

image::2step4-composition.jpg[composition,300]

Another copy was then made. This copy was colorized using the *colorize tool* into a orange colour seen eminating from behind the corridor. This copy was then upscaled using the *scale tool*. Finally a *eraser tool* was used on most of the body of this copy. Its opacity then changed to 7.

image::2step5-composition.jpg[composition,300]

==== Step 3) Final touches and text

Eyes of the mask were blackened using a brush tool of size 5. Text was added using the *Text tool*, text size is 60. Fonts being *Times New Roman, Bold* on "Jester's privilige" and *Times New Roman* on the rest.


//The left leg has been added using a paintbrush tool and colors picked from the present leg and shoe.
